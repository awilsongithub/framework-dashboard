# Client-Side Javascript Framework Dashboard
A live dashboard displaying Github API metrics (and a few other stats) for leading client-side Javascript frameworks.

## The problem
LaunchPad Lab is evaluating new client-side Javascript frameworks. To choose the "winning" technology, we need to compare:
- development activity
- community support
- stability
- other relevant information
- sorting and filtering of data is desirable

## Frameworks to be considered
- React: https://github.com/facebook/react
- Angular: https://github.com/angular/angular.js
- Ember: https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/
- Vue: https://github.com/vuejs/vue

## Dashboard Requirements  
- Dashboard with automatic page refreshing
- Display about 3 metrics from API data. Choose 3 that best indicate above to be compared from this list: Watchers, Stars, Forks, Commits, Pull Requests, Issues
- Build dashboard with any front-end
